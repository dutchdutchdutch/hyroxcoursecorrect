CourseCorrect
The Universal Standard for Hyrox Performance

The Problem
Hyrox athletes face a comparison problem: no two venues are created equal.
A 58-minute finish in Berlin isn't the same as 58 minutes in Boston. Run loops vary by 50+ meters. KB carry lengths are impacted by the number of lengths. SkiErg stations sit in different positions. Yet athletes, coaches, and the community treat all times as directly comparable—leading to frustration, confusion, and unfair self-assessment.
Current reality: Athletes don't know if they're improving or if they just raced an easier venue.

The Solution
CourseCorrect is a venue handicap system that normalizes Hyrox times across all race locations, giving athletes their true, venue-adjusted performance.
Think of it as golf's course rating system, but for Hyrox. Every venue gets a CourseCorrect Factor based on actual distance measurements, surface conditions, and station logistics. Athletes enter their finish time and venue—and instantly see how they actually stack up.

How It Works

Venue Profiling – We measure and rate every Hyrox venue based on run distance, sled track length/surface, station spacing, and elevation
Factor Calculation – Each venue receives a CourseCorrect Factor (e.g., 0.98 for "fast" courses, 1.03 for "slow" ones)
Time Adjustment – Athletes get their CourseCorrect Time—a normalized result comparable across all venues globally

Example:

Raw time: 58:30 (Manchester, Factor 1.02)
CourseCorrect Time: 59:42
This reveals your "true" performance vs. someone who ran 58:30 in Berlin (Factor 0.98 = 57:22 CourseCorrect Time)


Why It Matters
✅ Fair self-assessment – Know if you're actually improving or just racing easier venues
✅ Smart race selection – Choose venues strategically based on PR goals
✅ Community credibility – Leaderboards and comparisons finally mean something
✅ Coaching precision – Coaches can track true athlete progression across seasons

The Opportunity
Hyrox is exploding globally (150+ races, 100K+ participants annually). As the sport matures, athletes demand data precision. CourseCorrect becomes the standard—embedded in race apps, coaching platforms, and community leaderboards.
Revenue paths: Licensing to race organizers, premium athlete subscriptions, API for coaching platforms.

The Ask
We're building the database, algorithm, and athlete-facing tool. Seeking partnerships with Hyrox community leaders, data from race organizers, and early adopter athletes to validate the system.
CourseCorrect: Because your PR should mean the same thing everywhere.

Tagline options:

"Your true time, every time."
"Fair comparisons. Real progress."
"One standard. Every venue."
