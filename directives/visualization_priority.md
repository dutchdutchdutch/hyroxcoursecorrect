# Venue Handicap Visualization Priority

## Primary Visual: Venue Time Distribution

The **venue time distribution box plot** is the best visual indicator of the Course Factor and should be the primary graphic when presenting venue comparisons.

### Why This Works Best

1. **Immediate Visual Comparison**: Shows the full distribution of times at each venue
2. **Clear Difficulty Ranking**: Venues are sorted by median time (left = fastest, right = slowest)
3. **Shows Variance**: Box plots reveal not just average difficulty but consistency
4. **Intuitive**: Athletes and coaches immediately understand the visual

### Implementation

The venue distribution plot is generated by `venue_eda.py` and saved as:
```
.tmp/eda_plots/venue_time_distributions.png
```

### Presentation Order

When presenting multiple venues:

1. **Primary**: Venue Time Distribution Box Plot
   - Shows all venues side-by-side
   - Sorted by median time (fastest to slowest)
   - Includes sample sizes

2. **Secondary**: Handicap Factor Table
   - Numerical values for precise adjustments
   - Confidence intervals for statistical rigor

3. **Supporting**: Other visualizations
   - Sample size bar chart
   - Repeat athlete variance (if applicable)
   - Venue comparison heatmap

### Example Usage

```python
# Generate the primary visual
python3 execution/venue_eda.py --input .tmp/cleaned_results.csv --output-dir .tmp/eda_plots

# The primary visual is automatically saved as:
# .tmp/eda_plots/venue_time_distributions.png
```

This graphic should be featured prominently in:
- Reports and presentations
- Web dashboards
- Mobile apps
- Social media posts comparing venues
